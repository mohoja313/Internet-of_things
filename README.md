# Awesome Simple IoT Projects! üëã

Welcome! This is a collection of easy-to-understand projects to help you learn about the cool world of the Internet of Things (IoT). We use different ways for devices to talk to each other, like Socket, WebSocket, MQTT, API, and even just using your ESP32's Wi-Fi!

## What You'll Find Here üìÅ

Inside this project, you'll discover simple projects that show you how these different "communication methods" work. For each project, you'll get the computer code and a PowerPoint presentation (in Persian language) that explains everything you need to know.

The projects are organized into folders based on the communication method they use:

* **Socket:** Learn about a basic way for devices to send and receive information over a network.
* **WebSocket:** See how to create a continuous connection between your ESP32 and a server (like a website) to send information back and forth.
* **MQTT:** Discover a simple and popular way for IoT devices to send short messages to each other.
* **API:** Understand how different software programs can talk to each other and share data (often using the internet).
* **ESP32-WiFi:** Explore how to use the built-in Wi-Fi of your ESP32 to connect to your home network and communicate with other devices on the network.

In each of these folders, you will find the project files (the code) and a PowerPoint file with explanations in Persian.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Ready to try these projects? Here's what you need:

* An ESP32 board (you might need one or two, depending on the project).
* Arduino IDE: This is a free program that helps you write and upload code to your ESP32. You can download it here: [https://www.arduino.cc/software](https://www.arduino.cc/software)
* You also need to tell the Arduino IDE how to work with ESP32 boards. We explained how to do this in the last README, but if you need help, you can search online for "install ESP32 Arduino IDE".

Now, let's try running a project:

1.  Go into one of the folders (like `MQTT`).
2.  Find the file that ends with `.ino` (this is the Arduino code) and open it in the Arduino IDE.
3.  Connect your ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable.
4.  In the Arduino IDE, click on `Tools` in the top menu, then `Board`, and choose your ESP32 board (it might be called "ESP32 Dev Module" or something similar).
5.  Click on `Tools` again, then `Port`, and select the USB port that your ESP32 is connected to.
6.  Click the "Upload" button (it looks like a right-pointing arrow). Wait until the Arduino IDE says "Done uploading."

That's it! The code is now running on your ESP32. To understand what the project does and how to use it, open the PowerPoint file (the one ending with `.pptx`) in the same folder. It will have all the details in Persian.

## What Each Folder is About ü§î

Here's a little more about what you'll find in each folder:

* **Socket:** This shows you the most basic way for devices to send and receive data over a network. Think of it like a direct phone line between two devices.
* **WebSocket:** This is like a special phone line that stays open, allowing devices to send and receive messages instantly, like a chat.
* **MQTT:** Imagine a message board where devices can post and subscribe to information. It's a lightweight way for many IoT devices to communicate.
* **API:** This is like a menu in a restaurant. It lets different software programs ask for and get information from each other in a structured way (often using the internet).
* **ESP32-WiFi:** This shows you how to use the built-in Wi-Fi of your ESP32 to connect to your wireless network and communicate with other devices on the network.
